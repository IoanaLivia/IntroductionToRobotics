    Homework #1 : Controlling RGB Led
  </summary>

### Controlling RGB Led
  
### Components
* RGB Led 
* Potentiometers
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

### Publishing Task

* Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality and upload code to Github repo.

### [Coding Task](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/Homework1/Homework_1/Homework_1.ino)

* Coding style is at utmost importance. Check consistency in style and spacing.

### Picture of setup

**!** Common anode modifications: Put the common pin to 5V instead of GND (changing the wire per logic).

  <summary> Homework #2: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk </summary>

## Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk

### Components
* 5 Leds
* Button
* Buzzer
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Build the traffic lights for a crosswalk. Use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green) and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green). There are 4 states that the traffic lights system has to go through. 

  + State 1 : Default State (will be reinstated after State 4 ends)
  
     - Cars : Green Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound: none
     - Duration : indefinite (changed by pressing the button)
  
  + State 2 : initiated by counting down 8 seconds after a button press
 
     - Cars : Yellow Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound : none
     - Duration : 3 seconds
     
  + State 3 : initiated after State 2 ends

     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval
     - Duration : 8 seconds
     
  + State 4 : initiated after State 3 ends
     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Blinking Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval faster than the beeping in State 3
     - Duration : 8 seconds
     
     
**!** Pressing the button in any state other than state 1 should **NOT** yield any actions.
  
### Publishing Task

  * Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality and upload code to Github repo.

### Coding Task

  Coding style is of utmost importance. An important coding challenge present in this task is using millis() instead of delay().
  *Addendum* : using interrupts (properly coded: with debounce etc) yields a bonus.
