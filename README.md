  <summary> Homework #2: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk </summary>

## Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk

### Components
* 5 Leds
* Button
* Buzzer
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Build the traffic lights for a crosswalk. Use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green) and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green). There are 4 states that the traffic lights system has to go through. 

  + State 1 : Default State (will be reinstated after State 4 ends)
  
     - Cars : Green Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound: none
     - Duration : indefinite (changed by pressing the button)
  
  + State 2 : initiated by counting down 8 seconds after a button press
 
     - Cars : Yellow Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound : none
     - Duration : 3 seconds
     
  + State 3 : initiated after State 2 ends

     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval
     - Duration : 8 seconds
     
  + State 4 : initiated after State 3 ends
     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Blinking Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval faster than the beeping in State 3
     - Duration : 4 seconds
     
     
**!** Pressing the button in any state other than state 1 should **NOT** yield any actions.
  
### Publishing Task

  * Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality and upload code to Github repo.

### [Coding Task](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/%232/Homework_2/Homework_2.ino)

  Coding style is of utmost importance. An important coding challenge present in this task is using millis() instead of delay().
  *Addendum* : using interrupts (properly coded: with debounce etc) yields a bonus.
  
  **!** Prints of Serial Monitor Output that showcase functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/%232/Serial_2).

  <summary> Homework #3: Drawing on 7 segment display</summary>

## Drawing on 7 segment display
  
### Components
* 7-segment display
* Joystick
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use the joystick to control the position of the segment and *draw* on the display.  The movement between segments should be natural (meaning they should jump from the current positiononly to neighbors, but without passing through *walls*.

 + State 1 : Default State (also initiated after a button press in State 2)
  
     - Current segment : Blinking
     - Joystick : Can be used to move from one position to its neighbours.
     - Clicking the joystick :
        * *Short* pressing : toggles State 2.
        * *Long* pressing : resets the entired display by turning all segments OFF and moving the current position to the decimal point.
  
  + State 2 : Initiated after a button press in State 1
 
     - Current segment : Stops blinking ; Adopts the state of the segment before selection
     (ON / OFF)
     - Joystick : Toggling the X (or Y, depending on personal preference regarding implementation) axis should change the segment state to the opposite state (ON -> OFF, OFF -> ON) .
     - Clicking the joystick : save the segment state and exit back to State 1.
     
* Mentions

<ol>
  <li> Long pressing the button to reset should only be available in State 1. </li>
  
  <li> Joystick movements should be done with toggle, as presented in the laboratory. </li>
</ol>

* Mapping each segment to its neighbours

| Current Segment     | UP          | DOWN        | LEFT        | RIGHT       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| a           | N/A         | g           | f           | b           |

  <summary> Homework #4: Moving through 4-digit 7 segment display with the possibility to set digits</summary>
  
## Moving through 4-digit 7 segment display with the possibility to set digits
  
### Components
* 4 digit 7-segment display
* Joystick
* 74hc595 shift registers
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use the joystick to move through the 4 digit 7 segment displays digits, press the button to lock in on the current digitand use the other axis to increment or decrement the number. Keep the button pressed to reset all the digit values and the current position to thefirst digit in the first state.


  + State 1 : Default State (also initiated after a button press in State 2)
  
     - Current decimal point : Blinking
     - Joystick : Can be used to cycle through digits
     - Clicking the joystick : Locks in the selected digit and enters State 2.
  
   + State 2 : Initiated after a button press in State 1
  
     - Current decimal point : ON
     - Joystick : Can no longer be used to cycle through digits. Instead, using the other axis, can be used to increment/decrement the number on the current digit in HEX (0-F).
     - Clicking the joystick : Returns to State 1.
     
    + Reset : Toggled by long pressing the button in State 1
    
      - All digits go back to 0 and the current position is set to the first (rightmost) digit, in State 1.

* Mentions

  Keep in mind that when changing the number, you must increment it for each joystick movement - it should not work continuosly increment if you keep the joystick in one position.

  <summary> Homework #5: Matrix menu and simple game</summary>
  
  ## Matrix Menu and simple game
  
  ### Components
  * Matrix (8x8)
  * LCD display
  * Joystick
  * Resistors and wires (per logic)
  
  ### Technical Task
  
  Create a menu for your game, emphasis on the game.  You should scroll on the LCD with the joystick.  The menu should include the following functionality:
  <ol>
  <li>When powering up a game, a greeting message should be shown for a few moments.</li>
  <li>Should contain roughly the following categories:
  
  * *Start game* : 
    + starts the initial level of your game
  
  * *Highscore* :
  
    + Initially, we have 0.
  
    + Update  it  when  the  game  is  done.   Highest  possible  score should be achieved by starting at a higher level.
  
    + Save the top 5+ values in EEPROM with name and score.
  
  * *Settings* :
    + Enter name: The name should be shown in highscore. (Can also be displayed somewhere else too.)
    
    + Starting  level:  Set  the  starting  level  value.  The  idea  is  to be able to start from a higher level as well.  Can be replaced with difficulty.
    
    + LCD contrast control (optional, it replaces the potentiome-ter).  Save it to eeprom.
    
    + LCD brightness control (mandatory, must change LED wirethat’s directly connected to 5v).  Save it to eeprom.
    
    + Matrix brightness control (see function setIntesnity from theledControl library).  Save it to eeprom.
    
    + Sounds on or off.  Save it to eeprom.
    
    + Extra stuff can include items specific to the game mechanics or other settings such as chosen theme song etc.  Again, save it to eeprom.
    
  * *About* : 
    + Should include details about the creator(s) of the game. At least game name, author and github link or user (use scrolling text?)
    
  * *How to play* :
    + short and informative description
  
  </li>
  <li> While playing the game display relevant information regarding:
    
  * Lives

  * Level

  * Score

  * Time (Optional)

  * Player name (Optional)
    
  </li>
  
  <li> Upon game ending: 
  
  * Screen 1: a message such as ”Congratulations on reaching level/scoreX”.  "You did better than y people.".  etc.  Switches to screen 2 upon interaction (button press) or after a few moments.
  
  * Screen 2:  display relevant game info:  score, time, lives left etc. Must  inform  player  if  he/she  beat  the  highscore. This menu should only be closed by the player, pressing a button.
  </li>
</ol>

### Additional information

Keep in mind that you are creating a menu fora game. It should be intuitive and straight down obvious how to use it.  A good test is if you give it to someone that has no idea what it is - are they able to use it easily?  Think about when you pick up a game - the menu feels intuitive. Have fun!
