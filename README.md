# Introduction To Robotics (2022-2023)

Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1
## Controlling RGB Led

### Components
* RGB Led 
* Potentiometers
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

### Publishing Task

* Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality.

### [Coding Task](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/Homework1/Homework_1/Homework_1.ino)

* Coding style is at utmost importance. Check consistency in style and spacing.
