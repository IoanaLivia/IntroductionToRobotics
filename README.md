    Homework #1 : Controlling RGB Led
  </summary>

## Controlling RGB Led
  
### Components
* RGB Led 
* Potentiometers
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

### Publishing Task

* Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality and upload code to Github repo.

### [Coding Task](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/Homework1/Homework_1/Homework_1.ino)

* Coding style is at utmost importance. Check consistency in style and spacing.

### Picture of setup

**!** Common anode modifications: Put the common pin to 5V instead of GND (changing the wire per logic).

  <summary> Homework #2: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk </summary>

## Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk

### Components
* 5 Leds
* Button
* Buzzer
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Build the traffic lights for a crosswalk. Use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green) and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green). There are 4 states that the traffic lights system has to go through. 

  + State 1 : Default State (will be reinstated after State 4 ends)
  
     - Cars : Green Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound: none
     - Duration : indefinite (changed by pressing the button)
  
  + State 2 : initiated by counting down 8 seconds after a button press
 
     - Cars : Yellow Light
     - People : Red Light
     - Sound : none
     - Duration : 3 seconds
     
  + State 3 : initiated after State 2 ends

     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval
     - Duration : 8 seconds
     
  + State 4 : initiated after State 3 ends
     - Cars : Red Light
     - People : Blinking Green Light
     - Sound : Beeping Sound from the buzzer at a constant interval faster than the beeping in State 3
     - Duration : 4 seconds
     
     
**!** Pressing the button in any state other than state 1 should **NOT** yield any actions.
  
### Publishing Task

  * Update README with task requirements, picture of setup, link to video showcasing functionality and upload code to Github repo.

### [Coding Task](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/%232/Homework_2/Homework_2.ino)

  Coding style is of utmost importance. An important coding challenge present in this task is using millis() instead of delay().
  *Addendum* : using interrupts (properly coded: with debounce etc) yields a bonus.
  
  **!** Prints of Serial Monitor Output that showcase functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/IoanaLivia/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/Homework%20%5BCode%5D/%232/Serial_2).

  <summary> Homework #3: Drawing on 7 segment display</summary>

## Drawing on 7 segment display
  
### Components
* 7-segment display
* Joystick
* Resistors and wires (per logic)

### Technical Task

* Use the joystick to control the position of the segment and *draw* on the display.  The movement between segments should be natural (meaning they should jump from the current positiononly to neighbors, but without passing through *walls*.

 + State 1 : Default State (also initiated after a button press in State 2)
  
     - Current segment : Blinking
     - Joystick : Can be used to move from one position to its neighbours.
     - Clicking the joystick :
        * *Short* pressing : toggles State 2.
        * *Long* pressing : resets the entired display by turning all segments OFF and moving the current position to the decimal point.
  
  + State 2 : Initiated after a button press in State 1
 
     - Current segment : Stops blinking ; Adopts the state of the segment before selection
     (ON / OFF)
     - Joystick : Toggling the X (or Y, depending on personal preference regarding implementation) axis should change the segment state to the opposite state (ON -> OFF, OFF -> ON) .
     - Clicking the joystick : save the segment state and exit back to State 1.
     
* Mentions

<ol>
  <li> Long pressing the button to reset should only be available in State 1. </li>
  
  <li> Joystick movements should be done with toggle, as presented in the laboratory. (joy-Moved, etc) </li>
</ol>

* Mapping each segment to its neighbours

| Current Segment     | UP          | DOWN        | LEFT        | RIGHT       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| a           | N/A         | g           | f           | b           |
| b           | a           | g           | f           | N/A         |
| c           | g           | d           | e           | dp          |
| d           | g           | N/A         | e           | c           |
| e           | g           | d           | N/A         | c           |    
| f           | a           | g           | N/A         | b           |
| g           | a           | d           | N/A         | N/A         |
| dp          | N/A         | N/A         | c           | N/A         |
